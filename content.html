<h2>About:</h2>
<p>"I fell in love with photography at the age of 12, when I first picked up her mother's Polaroid Instamatic. I saved my allowance for eight months to buy my own camera, and spent the summer taking pictures of anything that didn't move, and even some things that did! My interest in portraiture developed when I started taking candid photos of classmates at my small Northern California middle school. I love the infinte diversity that you see between different people, and I wanted to capture everyone I saw.</p>
<p>
"I studied fine art with an emphasis on photography at the National College for the Arts in San Francisco, and spent every spare moment photographing every aspect of the city. After graduation I embraced urban living and opened my studio on The Embarcadero. Twenty years later, I love helping people expose a small piece of their souls in a tangible way."</p>
